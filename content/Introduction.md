This Excel add-in contains some miscellaneous features to facilitate some common difficulties I faced in daily works as a Structural/Civil Engineer. After loading the add-in, a new tab 'Useful Tools' will appear in the ribbon. All functions of this add-in are triggered by the button in this tab.
This tab will appear in every workbook unless you unload it. See [[Loading the Add-in]] for the details of loading the add-in.
